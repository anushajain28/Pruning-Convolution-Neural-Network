    "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most\n",
    "commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. Usually when we build a Convolution Neural\n",
    "Network with large number of neurons it can achieve the state-of-the-art performance for\n",
    "variety of computer vision tasks, but how large or deep a neural network can be, that is still a\n",
    "question. In this notebook we are trying to find the optimum number of neurons in a network so\n",
    "that it can retain its accuracy even when we reduce the network size. There are various pruning\n",
    "techniques to reduce the network architecture, we will try to remove the neurons with small\n",
    "weights and low variances. When we prune a neural network, there is a trade-off between\n",
    "accuracy and network size. Generally larger the network size better the performance but it also\n",
    "requires more computational power and cost. We are trying to reduce the computational\n",
    "power and cost by reducing the size of the network so that it can run on CPU’s and mobile\n",
    "devices.  \n",
    "\n",

    "the last layer i.e. the dense layer which has large number of neurons and try to maintain the\n",
    "accuracy that the original model has achieved.\n",
    "Our focus will be to study the behavior of each neuron once it is trained, we will try to find the\n",
    "neurons that are inactive or not participating in image classification and remove them from the\n",
    "network. Since, we are creating a CNN model with 2 convolution layers and 3 fully connected\n",
    "layers, the network size is around 5MB which is already small, can we make it smaller without\n",
    "making it worse that is the biggest question?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this research will be measured by comparing the Initial Accuracy vs Accuracy\n",
    "after the pruning and Initial Network Size vs Network Size after pruning. It is still an open\n",
